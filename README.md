SFCC SFRA Backend Developer Test
========

Usage of GIT is required. Create a repository for this task, solution for each STEP should be in a separate branch in your repository

### Considerations

•	The documentation starting on the README.md file need to be clear
•	We want to see not only the solution but also how you think and your working process, so please keep all your commits accessible and use proper naming standard for them
•	All steps are required so do not skip any. If you don't know, or don't feel comfortable with the required technology, just try your best and commit what you can

### STEP 1
Create a webhook to include three Custom Product attributes (Brand/MaxBuyQuantity/DiscountPercentage) into GET BASKET OCAPI

### STEP 2
Create a Decorator in SFRA to show Colors and Inventory information (add specific stock information to the product details) on PDP. 

### STEP 3

Create a Service for SMS gateway and using Service framework send SMS to customer on Order Confirmation at Checkout

### STEP 4
Test all the things. We are going to focus on functional tests. We can use MochaJs or whatever else tool, but we need to be able to run all the tests headless from the command line. 


### Wrapping up
In the README file, we should be able to find all the information necessary to run the project, the different challenges, and the test. Documentation is highly important for the resolution of this test.

### Delivery
If your repository is private, please share it with [r.katyal@gmg.com]
